# Summary

The objective here was to make the already-functioning HTML and CSS for this website more accessible and efficient by refactoring how some of the code had been written. 

The website features a navigation bar at the top, which should allow the user to jump to links farther down the page without scrolling.

There are two different groups of information, one being the different services provided by Horiseon and the other being benefits of the services provided by Horiseon.

# Development

I edited this HTML as part of week 1 of Bootcamp. I began with making sure the links on the navigation bar worked by adding an id attribute to one of the elements. 

After this, I focused on refactoring the code to try and maximize accessibility. I added alt tags to all the images, and changed some of the tags that were previously divs to more descriptive elements, such as footer or img. 

Finally, I took a look at the CSS and was able to consolidate the code by combining a good number of the classes that were previously defined.
